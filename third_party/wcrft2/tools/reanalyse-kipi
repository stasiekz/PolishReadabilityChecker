# Reads an XCES input (reference corpus), re-analyses it as plain text using the MACA config set below,
# synchronises the tokenisation and sentence division to ref corpus and outputs to $2.
#
# The result ($2) shall be the same corpus as ref ($1) but with morphology taken from the analyser.
# Forms assigned disamb interpretations that are unknown to the analyser are reverted to just this
# disamb plus one unknown word tag -- this is to tell the tagger that they are actually unknown.
#
# This whole procedure is to be run against the training data to mimic the conditions met during
# regular tagging: the same forms should appear unknown when training and when tagging.
