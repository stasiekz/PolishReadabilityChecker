 * May be used on different levels of abstraction:
 * * tag whole file or stream and write output to file or stream,
 * * tag singular sentence or paragaph and directly access tagged output using
 *   Corpus2 data structures (this way you can consume parts of tagger output
 *   as soon as they are produced and don't need to store whole tagged material
 *   before using it).
 * Tagger object also allows for tagger training and saving of trained model
 * to model_dir.
