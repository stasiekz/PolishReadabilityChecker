/**
 * A SRX parser wrapping a UnicodeSource.
 *
 * Characters from the wrapped source are put in a buffer, treated as
 * a "window" with margins one each side (so the total size of the buffer
 * is window + margin * 2. SRX sentence breaks that happen to lay inside
 * the window are computed and later available through the UnicodeSource
 * overriden peek_begins_sentence().
 *
 * The buffer layout is: left_margin window right_margin
 *
 * Initially, the left buffer is empty.
 *
 * Note that this class does not understand SRX, it just takes a SRX
 * segmenter and runs it repeatedly on a buffer. Characters are always
 * returned from the window area of the buffer, advancing the internal
 * pointer. When the pointer starts pointing to the beginning of the right
 * margin, the buffer is moved so that the last margin_width characters of
 * the window form the new left margin, and new characters are streamed
 * from the wrapped source. SRX segment breaks are then computed again and
 * the internal pointer is reset to point at the beginning of the window.
 *
 * Larger windows should yield more performance, and large margin sizes
 * will result in preformance drop. However, the margin size must be large
 * enough to contain the longest regex match expected, otherwise results
 * may be off. Technically the restriction is slightly more loose, but the
 * aforementioned rule of thumb is reasonable anyway.
