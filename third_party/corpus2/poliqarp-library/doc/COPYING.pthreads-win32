The ``win32/pthreads/`` directory contains the pthreads-win32 library, version
2.8.0. It has been downloaded from http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/.
The source is modified in that it's trimmed to ``*.c`` and ``*.h`` files (the
documentation and tests deleted) and there is a brand new Makefile which
fits neatly into Poliqarp's build process.
